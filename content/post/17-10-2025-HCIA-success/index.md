Whassup people. Chronic Cert Collector here! Long story short, I recently got the Huawei Certified ICT Associate (HCIA) Datacom. Honestly, it was a refresh of CCNA topics, however, there are a few extra topics that is emphasised in HCIA Datacom but not CCNA, which I will get into later.
## General Tips
1. The information in Huawei ICT Academy is sufficient to pass the exam.
2. A lab is not needed to pass (in my opinion), however, I highly recommend having labs because hands-on experience is absolutely invaluable. I hate memorizing commands.
3. For those that come from Cisco background, familiarize yourself with the terms and commands used. Not everything is 1-to-1 with Cisco.
4. Some interesting differences include:

| CCNA                                                                         | HCIA                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Default administrative distance of internal OSPF is higher than static route | Default preference of internal OSPF is lower than that of static route                        |
| No concept of "hybrid" ports. (At least at the CCNA level)                   | Hybrid ports are taught, basically switchports that can forward more than one vlans untagged. |
| PPP and PPPOE theory and configuration not emphasised.                       | PPP and PPPOE theory and configuration are emphasised.                                        |
| WLAN not very emphasised.                                                    | WLAN is very emphasised.                                                                      |
| Python Automation is not touched on.                                             | A bit of Python Automation.                                                                   |
## Conclusion
Overall, I think this is an OK exam. However, would I have taken it if it wasn't sponsored by my university? No. I think CCNA is better as it emphasised (a bit) more on practical skills and requires deeper knowledge. 

P.S. I love my prof in UM <3
